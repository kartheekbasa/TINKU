			Python
			------
what is Python?
--------------
Python is a General Purpose Programming Language
Python is a High-Level Programming Language
Python is a Multi-Paradigm
Python support both Interactive Mode and Batch Mode Executions

		(or)

Python is a General Purpose,High-Level,Interpreted,Interactive,Modular,
Dynamically Typed,Garbage Collected,Procedure Oriented,Object Oriented and Scripting Programming Language.

History of Python:
-------------------
the Python was developed by the Guido Van Rossum in the year of 1991(actually this project implementation is started in the early of 1980's i.e., 1989)

the name python was derived from the Guido Van Rossum favourite TV fun show "the complete monty python's flying circus".

he is a Dutch Programmer, best known as a Creator of the python programming language i.e., he is a father of Python Programming Language.

currently he is working in microsoft.

the python programming language implementation is influenced by two programming languages, they are

	ABC
	Modula3

Advantages of Python:
---------------------
1).Simple Syntax
	in python, there's no concept of ;,{},()
	python simply follows Space Indentation concept

ex: if block representation
---
	C/C++/Java			Python
	----------			-------
	if(condition)			if condition:
	{					stmt_1
	    stmt_1;				stmt_2
	      stmt_2;				......
	    ......			        stmt_n
	  stmt_n;
	}

2).Less Code
	python programs having less code when compared to other programming languages programs code like C,C++,Java,C#,....

ex:
---
write a c-program,to print "hello world"?

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
  printf("hello world");
}

write a Java program, to print "hello world"?

import java.io.*;
class Test
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("hello world");
    }
}

write a Python program,to print "hello world"?

print("hello world")

3).Dynamically Typed Language

ex:
----
write a C program(static typed language) to perform the addition operation on two different types of numerical data?

#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
   int x=10;
   float y=2.3;
   float z=x+y;
   printf("%f",z);
}


write a Python program(Dynamically typed language) to perform the addition operation on two different types of numerical data?

x=10
y=2.3
z=x+y
print(z)

4).python support N-no.of builtin libraries/packages/modules


Feature's of Python:
---------------------
1).Easy-To-Learn
2).Easy-To-Read
3).Easy-To-Maintain
4).Easy-To-Use
5).CrossPlatform/Portable
6).Scalable
7).Secure
8).Flexible
9).Extendable
10).Platform Independent
11).Strongly Typed Language
12).Interpreted Language
13).Garbage Collected
14).Free and OpenSource
15).it support all types of database connections

note:
----
python is a completely free and opensource project, it is maintained by PSF(Python Software Foundation) team.
