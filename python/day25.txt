		Control Flow Statements
		-----------------------
the Control Flow statements are used to control the flow of the program execution.

why we need to Control the Flow of the Program Execution?
---------------------------------------------------------
in Any programming Language program, by default all the statements are executed at only once.

if we want to execute some statements repeatedly, if we want to skip the execution of some statements, in that cases we need to control the flow of the program execution.

how to control the flow of the program execution?
--------------------------------------------------
we can control the flow of the program execution by using control flow statements.

the control flow statements can be categorized into 3-types, they are

	1).Conditional/Sequential Statement's

	2).Looping/Iterative Statement's

	3).Jumping/Transform Statement's


what is condition?
------------------
any expression to return the result as boolean values, that type of expressions are called conditions.

x,y=10,3

x+y	--> 13		--> expression
x-y	--> 7		--> expression
x*y	--> 30		--> expression
x==y	--> False	--> expression		--> Condition
x!=y	--> True	--> expression		--> Condition
x>y	--> True	--> expression		--> Condition
x&y	--> 2		--> expression
x|y	--> 11		--> expression


what is block?
--------------
in python, the group of statements which are follow the same space indentation, is known as a block/clause.

	C/C++/Java			Python
	----------			-------
      stmt_1				stmt_1
      stmt_2				stmt_2
      {					     stmt_a
         stmt_a				     stmt_b
	 stmt_b				     ......
	 ......				     stmt_z
	 stmt_z
       }				stmt_n-1
      stmt_n-1				stmt_n
      stmt_n


Conditional statements:
----------------------
the Conditional statements are used to execute the block of statements or to skip the execution of block of statements or to execute one block of statements among from multiple blocks of statements.

the python supported conditional statements are,

	if
	if else
	if elif else (in c programming if else-if else)
	elif ladder (in c programming else-if ladder)
	nested if
	match-case (in c programming switch case concept)

if block:
----------
we can define any block,which is preceeded by "if" keyword, that block is called "if" block.

	syntax
	------
	if condition: stmt

		(or)

	if condition:
		stmt_1
		stmt_2
		......
		stmt_n

		(or)

	if(condition):
		stmt_1
		stmt_2
		......
		stmt_n

ex:
---
print("hai")
num=int(input("enter your number: "))
if num>5:print("siva")

output1:
--------

enter your number: 3
bye

output2:
--------
hai
enter your number: 9

ex:
---
print("hai")
hour=int(input("enter time in hours: "))
if hour<=11.59:
    print("siva")
    print("good morning")
else:
    print("rama")
    print("good afternoon")
print("bye")

output1:
--------
hai
enter time in hours: 8
siva
good morning
bye

output2:
--------
hai
enter time in hours: 13
rama
good afternoon
bye

ex2:
----
write a program to check whether that particular person is eligible for voter registration or not based on age?

name=input("enter your name: ")
age=int(input("enter your age: "))
if age>=18:
    print("Congratulations %s"%name)
    print("you are eligible for voter registration")
else:
    print("Sorry %s"%name)
    print("you are not eligible for voter registration")

output1:
-------
enter your name: siva
enter your age: 12
Sorry siva
you are not eligible for voter registration

output2:
--------
enter your name: rama
enter your age: 19
Congratulations rama
you are eligible for voter registration
