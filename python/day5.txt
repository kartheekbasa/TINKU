Batch Mode:
-----------
in Batch Mode, we can write the one or more python statements into a single file, we can save that file with ".py" extension and executeing that file.

how to implement the Batch Mode?
--------------------------------
we can implement the Batch Mode in two ways, they are

	1).by using Editor's

	2).by using IDE's

what is Editor?
--------------
	an Editor is an application software,which will provides good environment to writeing the source code(programs).

	windows		--> notepad,notepad++,editplus,...

	linux/mac	--> vi editor,nano editor,text editor,...

how to working with Editor's?
-----------------------------
	open any one editor in our computer/machine
			|
	goto file menu and to select new file
			|
	to write the one or more python statements into that file
			|
	to save that file with .py extension

ex:
---
	C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\Desktop\\mydemo.py
	--------------------------------------
print("hello world")


how to run python file/script through cmd/terminal?
----------------------------------------------------
	if we want to run the python file/script through cmd/terminal,in that case we are using following syntax/command.

	python filename.py

ex:
---
C:\Users\Lenovo>python mydemo.py
python: can't open file 'C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\mydemo.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

C:\Users\Lenovo>python C:\\Users\\Lenovo\\Desktop\\mydemo.py
hello world

	(or)

C:\Users\Lenovo>cd desktop

C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop>python mydemo.py
hello world

ex2:
----
	D:\\demoproj\\cal.py
	--------------------
x=10
y=20
print(x+y)
print(x-y)
print(x*y)

	output
	------
C:\Users\Lenovo>python D:\\demoproj\\cal.py
30
-10
200

	(or)
C:\Users\Lenovo>d:

D:\>cd demoproj

D:\demoproj>python cal.py
30
-10
200

problems in Editor's?
-----------------------
in Editor's, the development of the application takes more time.

the Editor's don't support automatic debugging concept.

note:
-----
to overcome the problems in Editor's,in realtime we are going to using the concept called IDE's.

what is IDE's?
---------------
IDE's(Integrated Development Environment's)

the IDE's are tools,which will provides good environment to Faster Development of the applications.

the IDE's support automatic debugging concept's.

the python supported IDE's are,

	idle
	pycharm
	pydev
	spyder
	eclipse
	netbeans
	vs code IDE
	jupyter notebook
	atom
	....
	....

idle:
-----
the idle is a default python IDE,but it is not a standard IDE.

the idle support both Interactive Mode and Batch Mode.


how to working with interactive mode in idle?
----------------------------------------------
	goto search and by typing idle
		     |
	to select any one idle in our computer
	

how to working with batch mode in idle?
---------------------------------------
	goto search and by typing idle
		     |
	to select any one idle in our computer
		     |
	goto file menu and to select new file
		     |
	to write the one or more python statements into that file
		     |
	to save that file with .py extension

how to run python file/module/script in idle?
----------------------------------------------
	goto run menu
	     |
	click on run module

		(or)

	to press F5	(or)	Fn+F5


note:
-----
except idle, if we want to working with any another IDE's first we need to download and install manually.

how to download Pycharm IDE?
---------------------------
	goto www.jetbrains.com
		    |
	goto Developer tools menu
		    |
	goto IDE's section
		    |
	to select pycharmIDE
		    |
	click on download
		    |
	to select our operating system and
	to download any one file(community/professional)
